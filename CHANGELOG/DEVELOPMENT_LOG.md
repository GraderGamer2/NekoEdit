# NekoEdit development log

This is an append-only narrative log. New entries go at the top, with the newest work first. The complete historical narrative is in [PROJECT_HISTORY.md](PROJECT_HISTORY.md); the full SHA/subject ledger is in [COMMIT_INDEX.md](COMMIT_INDEX.md).

## 2026-11-06 — Create permanent changelog and recover full project history

**Purpose:** Establish a durable development record before any further feature work, so a new ChatGPT conversation can reconstruct project context from the repository instead of depending on a long previous chat.

### Repository reconstruction

- Inspected the active repository, the original `main` prototype history, development PR #1, source tree, build files, architecture/backend documentation, and test harness.
- Reconstructed the complete history available on 2026-11-06: 20 commits on the original `main` prototype history and 168 commits in PR #1.
- Added `CHANGELOG/COMMIT_INDEX.md` with all 188 commit subjects, dates, abbreviated/full linked commit identities, including tests, intermediate debugging, documentation changes, fixes, and reverts.
- Added `CHANGELOG/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` with a functional milestone narrative: original freestanding Wayland window; inherited socket/error reporting; pointer/keyboard input; ASCII editing and UI; selection, key repeat, wrapping and scrolling; file loading and atomic saving; XKB keymap transport/parser; complete printable ASCII punctuation; and UTF-8 code-point-safe editing.
- Added `CHANGELOG/README.md` with instructions for future development chats and a mandatory changelog-maintenance procedure.
- Added this file as the append-only narrative log.
- Added `CHANGELOG/CURRENT_STATUS.md` as the concise source-of-truth snapshot.
- Added a link to this directory from the root project README.

### Code milestone included in the reconstructed history

The latest implementation work before this retrospective changelog task added code-point-safe editing around existing UTF-8 document bytes:

- `doc_utf8_next` and `doc_utf8_prev` validate bounded UTF-8 scalar sequences.
- Left/Right, Shift+Left/Right, pointer hit-testing, selection rendering, Backspace, and Delete operate on whole valid code points instead of splitting valid 2-, 3-, and 4-byte sequences.
- Malformed bytes remain independently editable.
- The fixed 64 KiB byte array remains; this did not implement the planned gap buffer.
- Non-ASCII rendering remains a `?` placeholder, keyboard text entry remains ASCII-only, and grapheme/IME support is not implemented.

Related code/test/docs commits (all individual entries are in [COMMIT_INDEX.md](COMMIT_INDEX.md)):

- `70a333fc5392` — UTF-8 code-point-safe editing implementation.
- `056b381ab571`, `711613327410` — UTF-8 navigation/deletion and selection regression tests.
- `29ea6773e2`, `f9bc6f5df0`, `ec5d5ef33a`, `fd14288098` — correct test dispatch, better failure diagnostics, fixture positioning, and malformed-byte fixture coverage.
- `6e401497373c`, `749d1cc085d2`, `998577b6e09a` — update README, architecture, and Wayland backend documentation.
- `b71fa066fd3a`, `5c8b0aea3ed9`, `6cd9e08fada0` — pointer hit-testing coverage and test-fixture corrections.

### Verification

- GitHub Actions [run #160](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42213034086) passed for code commit `6cd9e08fada059ae3e24c9cdab7cf86762b24414`.
- Passed stages: freestanding x86-64 build and ELF checks; command-line smoke tests; complete Wayland mock-compositor integration; executable inspection; Linux x86-64 artifact upload.
- The integration suite includes the original Wayland, keyboard, pointer, file workflow, XKB, punctuation, repeat, valid UTF-8, malformed UTF-8, selection, deletion, and mixed-width UTF-8 pointer hit-testing cases.
- Artifact: `nekoedit-linux-x86_64`; archive SHA-256 `aa47ef8e0645e734f7dd7bd072cd31f51cc755907113603de6aebf8ab48917a7`; artifact expiry reported as 2026-11-13.
- User feedback: the printable symbol input set `!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:"<>?` works in the tested Actions build. The user also reported that the UTF-8 formatting/editing change looked fine and that earlier implementations remained usable. These are user-reported results, separate from CI verification.

### Outcome and scope

This task changes documentation only; it does not intentionally modify editor code or the launch interface. The existing Wayland launch form remains supported: `./nekoedit --backend=wayland` (or `./build/nekoedit --backend=wayland` when running the Makefile output).

No feature development is being started in this entry. The next development task should begin only after reading the changelog directory and inspecting the current source/branch/CI state.
