## 2026-11-09 — publish first external Compose locale data set

**Branch:** `early-alpha`; PR [#2](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/pull/2) remains open, unmerged, and clean.
**Source/tooling commits:** [d5f96921ef9e](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/d5f96921ef9e9cf1e052a6509003b827769af9ca), [15cf37c949fa](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/15cf37c949facfeb5038915f90b8f1917cf3afdf), and [7871f5256b89](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/7871f5256b89789e348b52801ebaecbca86e2a0a).

**CI:** [Build and test #704](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42579353889) passed all 12 workflow steps. It built NekoEdit, ran CLI/host tests and the complete Wayland mock, inspected the freestanding ELF, fetched the pinned X.Org inputs, verified all three upstream Git blob IDs, regenerated the locale JSON byte-for-byte, built the .nlp pack, and uploaded both artifacts.

- Added the first non-en_US dataset, **pt_BR.UTF-8**, as a complete flattened table: the pinned X.Org libX11 en_US Compose baseline followed by Brazilian Portuguese additions/overrides. The importer follows the single en_US include and resolves input keysyms using the pinned xorgproto `keysymdef.h`.
- The dataset contains **2,908 rules**: 2,220 two-input, 582 three-input, and 106 four-input sequences. One hundred rules produce multiple Unicode scalars. Three locale rules override a base mapping; one shorter sequence is omitted because it prefixes a longer sequence.
- Dead-key-led rules and input keysyms that cannot be represented as Unicode scalars by NLP1 v1 are excluded. These omissions and their counts are retained in the JSON statistics.
- Added `tools/import_xcompose.py` with strict single-include handling, X.Org keysym alias resolution, C-style quoted output parsing, override merging, deterministic sorting/prefix filtering, and atomic JSON output.
- Added pinned source revisions/blob IDs, importer statistics, and a redistribution notice under `data/locales/`. The pack is data-only; no upstream executable code or runtime library is bundled.
- CI verifies downloaded source blob hashes, regenerates `pt_BR.UTF-8.json` byte-for-byte, and uses `make locale-packs` to build `pt_BR.UTF-8.nlp`. The standard build uploads the pack separately; the Release workflow attaches the pack and notice when a GitHub Release is published.
- Wayland mock tests confirm pair/multi-output, triple, and four-input resolution through the real locale loader; unknown sequences fall back literally and Escape/Backspace cancel buffered prefixes.

**Locale pack:** 151,288 bytes uncompressed (2,908 × 52-byte records + 72-byte header). Actions artifact [13656596918](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42579353889/artifacts/13656596918) is a 17,943-byte ZIP; SHA-256 `e644d2d0f20f499a0ce6b50872ca2aa688243ebdffaaaa6f7431c5f4b9bfb132`. It expires 2026-11-16 07:26:59 UTC.

**Editor binary:** 119,239 bytes. Actions artifact [13657030709](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42579353889/artifacts/13657030709) has ZIP SHA-256 `1ea57032f6db13c84ddcfafcf4b5bd8dc1973b518164c91a2e969b6ff16dfb01`; it expires 2026-11-16 07:27:00 UTC.

### Remaining locale work and validation boundary

The first data pack and Release attachment workflow are implemented, but no new project Release was published in this task, so the pack is not yet attached to a versioned end-user release. More locale datasets, Settings-based selection/install/remove, automatic system-locale discovery, system/user Compose-file import, and locale-specific dead-key behavior remain future work. CI/mock coverage is verified; live GNOME/Mutter testing of an installed pt_BR pack remains outstanding. The editor remains offline-capable with built-in en_US and does not automatically download data.

## 2026-11-09 — implement optional Compose locale packs

**Implementation:** [77f1df75cb0d](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/77f1df75cb0dba7042119b3c158a8d618a4dce27); test correction [f461a9da7cb2](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/f461a9da7cb2ef9108bb2b19b4c06e697df8f64a); runtime fallback correction [8e4e53bcd678](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/8e4e53bcd678bb9d281f69e5aaaa7a9432408a0f). Branch `early-alpha`; PR [#2](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/pull/2) remains open and unmerged.

**CI:** [Build and test #701](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42576739750) — all eight workflow steps passed, including the complete Wayland mock, ELF inspection, and artifact upload.

- Kept **en_US.UTF-8** as the embedded default. A non-default locale is selected explicitly through `NEKOEDIT_LOCALE=<locale-tag>`; its data file is loaded from `$HOME/.nekoedit/locales/<locale-tag>.nlp`.
- Added NLP1, a versioned, data-only format with a 72-byte header and 52-byte records. It supports 2–4 input Unicode scalars and 1–8 output scalars. The runtime caps packs at 2 MiB and 32,768 records.
- The loader checks magic/version, header and record sizes, locale-tag match, file/payload length, CRC-32, flags/reserved bytes, strict sequence ordering, duplicate/prefix ambiguity, output/input counts, Unicode scalar validity, and zero-filled unused slots. Invalid/missing packs fall back atomically to built-in en_US.
- A selected pack replaces the active Compose table; it does not merge with en_US. This avoids precedence and timeout ambiguity. The existing six dead-key actions remain separate.
- Added `tools/compose_pack.py`, a standard-library-only JSON-to-NLP1 builder. Python is a build/release tool and test dependency only, not a runtime dependency.
- The Wayland mock validates a real loaded pack through keyboard events: a pair producing two scalars, a three-key rule, a four-key rule, literal fallback for an unknown pair, and Escape/Backspace cancellation. A CRC-corrupt pack is rejected and leaves en_US active. Host tests cover header/CRC encoding, sorting, duplicate/prefix rejection, unsafe locale tags, invalid scalars, and output limits.
- No executable plugin code, shared object, network access, or automatic download was introduced.

**Artifact:** [nekoedit-linux-x86_64 — 13656010309](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42576739750/artifacts/13656010309)  
**Size:** 119,239 bytes  
**Expires:** 2026-11-16 07:02:43 UTC.

### Remaining locale work and validation boundary

Actual non-en_US release assets, a Settings locale selector/installer, automatic selection from system locale variables, system/user Compose-file import, locale-specific dead-key rules, and release-pack provenance/licensing workflows remain future work. The pack loader and test fixture have passed CI; this does not claim manual testing of an installed non-en_US pack in live GNOME/Mutter. The core editor remains usable offline with built-in en_US.

## 2026-11-09 — implement minimal document context menu

**Implementation:** [0c9fee44200b](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/0c9fee44200b1528c1c3d148dd525c5319c6dd7d) on the early-alpha branch; PR [#2](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/pull/2) remains open.  
**CI:** [Build and test #698](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42571651703) — all eight workflow steps passed on the first attempt.

- Added a small in-surface right-click menu in the document viewport with exactly three commands: **Copy**, **Paste**, and **Cut**. The popup is positioned at the pointer and clamped to the document viewport/window.
- Opening the popup does not move the caret or discard the current selection. Escape, another right-click, and an outside left-click dismiss it; the outside click does not activate the covered control.
- Copy and Cut reuse the existing immutable Wayland clipboard snapshots and data-source implementation. The clipboard code now uses the most recent input serial, including the menu-item pointer-press serial required for a pointer-triggered Wayland set_selection request.
- Paste reuses the existing asynchronous Wayland data-offer receive path. The mock verifies insertion, one Undo action, and Redo.
- Added an end-to-end mock scenario for right-click opening, Escape dismissal, selection retention, Copy snapshot contents, Cut snapshot-before-delete behavior, external asynchronous Paste, Undo/Redo, and outside-click dismissal. The scenario tests the real data-device protocol rather than only checking UI state.
- No new build/runtime dependency or separate clipboard process was introduced for the menu.
- **Artifact:** [nekoedit-linux-x86_64 — 13653517472](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42571651703/artifacts/13653517472), 116,962 bytes; SHA-256 8fef7f76439a09c662161cc65b24241a6efc425dd6ee3ea942243a72059d2b80.

### Validation boundary

The complete Wayland mock and ELF checks passed in CI. This is not a claim that the menu has already been manually checked on the user's live GNOME/Mutter desktop; that visual/input retest remains separate.

### Locale-pack implementation update

The NLP1 runtime loader, pack builder, and first external dataset (pt_BR.UTF-8) are implemented on `early-alpha`; see the latest status entry at the top of this file. The pack is a complete en_US-derived table with pt_BR overrides and a pinned source notice. CI rebuilds it from verified upstream Git blobs, compares the JSON byte-for-byte, and uploads the standalone `.nlp` asset. The Release workflow attaches it when a GitHub Release is published. Settings-based installation/selection, more locales, system/user Compose imports, automatic locale discovery, and locale-specific dead keys remain future work.

**Snapshot date:** 2026-11-09 (Asia/Jakarta).

## 2026-11-09 — add three-symbol XKB Compose sequences

**Implementation commit:** [bf3a1891dd63](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/bf3a1891dd6318ad70f99bf7e75e4afbf481dc56)  
**CI:** [Build and test #42564500183](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42564500183) — first attempt passed all eight steps.

- Extended the static `en_US.UTF-8`-derived Compose data with **564 three-symbol sequences**, in addition to the **2,140 two-symbol pairs** from the previous milestone. The triple table is 9,040 bytes including its sentinel; it adds no runtime/build dependency.
- Added a second buffered scalar and prefix check. After `Multi_key`, a second input is held only when it prefixes one of the supported triples. The third input resolves the sequence; a nonmatching third input is flushed literally with the first two symbols.
- The table avoids triples whose first two symbols already resolve as a pair, so existing pair mappings still resolve immediately. The current upstream source has 106 four-symbol sequences; they remain unsupported.
- The Wayland mock verifies `minus minus period` → U+2013 EN DASH and `minus minus minus` → U+2014 EM DASH, the two-symbol-prefix buffer state, and Backspace cancellation without document mutation.
- Updated [docs/COMPOSE.md](../docs/COMPOSE.md), README, and regression coverage. Source is still a static `en_US.UTF-8` subset, not locale-aware system or user Compose-file loading.

**CI result:** all eight steps passed on the first attempt: freestanding build/ELF checks, CLI and host tests, full Wayland mock, executable inspection, and artifact upload. Artifact [13650369672](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42564500183/artifacts/13650369672) is 116,277 bytes; ZIP SHA-256 `4b4234c8a9a493b0f389005f55f0da9a4bd6cdd9c962cea8bd832773a1a6b174`; expiry 2026-11-16 04:57:02 UTC.

### Remaining Compose scope

Four-symbol sequences, multi-scalar output results, locale selection, locale Compose-file loading, XCompose includes/substitutions, `~/.XCompose`, and broader dead-key coverage remain future work. The real GNOME/Mutter keyboard path still needs physical-layout verification.

## 2026-11-09 — expand XKB Multi_key Compose baseline

**Implementation commit:** [31c1bd47575e](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/31c1bd47575ee776701bd106d8d25dcd33219432)  
**CI:** [Build and test #42563677349](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42563677349) — retry attempt 2 passed all eight workflow steps.

- Replaced the fixed 40-pair `Multi_key` lookup with **2,140 two-symbol pairs**: 2,133 distinct one-scalar-output pairs extracted from X.Org libX11's `en_US.UTF-8` Compose source, plus seven original NekoEdit pairs absent from that source.
- All 40 original NekoEdit entries take precedence on collisions, including the existing slash/slash output.
- The static table occupies **25,692 bytes** including its sentinel. No runtime or build dependency was added; the two-symbol state machine and Wayland key-event path were retained.
- Added end-to-end mock checks for `period period` → U+2026, `S S` → U+1E9E, and `period greater` → U+203A. They compare document UTF-8 bytes, independently of font glyph availability.
- Added [docs/COMPOSE.md](../docs/COMPOSE.md) with source revision, attribution, tests, and limitations.

**Scope boundary:** this is an `en_US.UTF-8`-derived static two-symbol baseline, not locale-selected Compose. It does not read locale Compose files, `~/.XCompose`, `$XCOMPOSEFILE`, or XCompose include directives. Three-/four-symbol sequences, multi-codepoint results, locale selection, and remaining dead-key actions are still open work.

**CI result:** attempt 1 failed in an earlier held-Enter caret assertion before reaching the new Compose tests; the same failed job was retried without source changes. Attempt 2 passed all eight steps, including the full Wayland mock, ELF inspection, and artifact upload. Artifact [13650009531](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42563677349/artifacts/13650009531) is 113,011 bytes; ZIP SHA-256 `d7cd58ba93aac6efaeb88149f497d74ce0f74d9bd5c9f4fa7811f9a237790a2d`; it expires 2026-11-16 04:48:29 UTC.

## Font rendering note

The user reported question marks when trying scripts without corresponding installed glyphs. Inspection confirms the TrueType renderer substitutes the selected font's `?` glyph when its cmap has no mapping for the requested Unicode scalar. That is a **rendering fallback**, not evidence that the keyboard inserted U+003F; integration checks inspect document bytes. Cross-font glyph fallback is not implemented yet. Correctly stored Unicode can still appear as a question mark until a font with the glyph is selected.

# Earlier NekoEdit status snapshot — before the locale-pack implementation

## 2026-11-09 — expand named XKB Unicode keysyms — Actions #695 passed

**Branch:** `early-alpha`; PR [#2](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/pull/2) remains open and mergeable against `main`.
**Implementation/test/documentation commit:** [2e50f35a1ebc](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/commit/2e50f35a1ebccfb6b2feb919a35e28c0605ede79).

- Expanded the static named-key lookup from 280 retained legacy entries to **1,642 X.Org Unicode-annotated keysym/action aliases**. It is generated from X.Org `keysymdef.h` Unicode annotations, also resolving legacy aliases that share a numeric keysym value with an annotated name. No runtime library or external build dependency was introduced.
- Added the published xorgproto 2026.1 aliases: `SSHARP` (U+1E9E), single-angle quotation marks (U+2039/U+203A), XF86 phone-numeric digits/star/pound, and `dead_apostrophe` through the existing acute-accent action.
- Wayland mock parser-memory checks cover Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Hangul, Armenian, Georgian, Kana, Sinhala, Braille, German capital sharp S, angle quotation marks, phone-numeric keysym, and the dead-apostrophe marker. End-to-end key events verify UTF-8 insertion for twelve named characters/phone aliases and that `dead_apostrophe` arms and completes the existing acute composition path.
- Added `docs/KEYSYM_UNICODE.md` documenting the table, test scope, remaining limits, source provenance, and source notices. README implementation and roadmap summaries no longer describe the old 273-name curated subset.
- Actions [Build and test #695](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42560170496) passed all eight workflow steps: freestanding build/ELF checks, CLI and host tests, the full Wayland mock, executable inspection, and artifact upload. The mock log confirms the extended multilingual scalar table and actual UTF-8 typing tests passed.

**Artifact:** [nekoedit-linux-x86_64 — 13648893107](https://github.com/GraderGamer2/NekoEdit/actions/runs/42560170496/artifacts/13648893107)  
**Size:** 104,167 bytes  
**SHA-256:** `5762e219685c3734e77e8b2bd7e9fad0bdb39d3ca4c742d969fe330a8d407c4c`  
**Expires:** 2026-11-16 04:09:24 UTC.

### User-reported desktop behavior

The user reports that the previous build works perfectly and that no visible behavior change is apparent. The new named-key additions are CI/mock-verified; multilingual physical-key typing has not yet been separately confirmed on live GNOME/Mutter. The earlier manual confirmation that `Ctrl+Shift+Left` selects words correctly remains recorded.

### Roadmap request at this earlier snapshot

At this snapshot, the right-click document context menu had not yet been implemented. It was delivered in the subsequent context-menu milestone recorded above. The currently verified menu contains exactly **Copy**, **Paste**, and **Cut**.

### Remaining keyboard-layout scope

The parser now covers the expanded named Unicode table and the previously validated bounded XKB type, modifier-map, compatibility-predicate, preserve/consumed-modifier, virtual-modifier, and repeat subsets. This is not complete libxkbcommon or full locale Compose support. The optional NLP1 loader supports installed locale tables, but system/user Compose-file import, automatic system-locale selection, locale-specific dead-key actions, and release-pack selection UI remain unfinished. Stateful modifier/group actions and compatibility indicators remain compositor-owned or unfinished; advanced IME preedit attributes also remain incomplete. Live GNOME/Mutter testing with real keymaps and an input method remains outstanding. Glyph appearance also depends on the selected font containing the mapped character.

**Snapshot date:** 2026-11-09 (Asia/Jakarta).
